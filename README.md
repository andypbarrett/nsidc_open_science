# Tactics for an Open Science strategy at the National Snow and Ice Data Center
## What is Open Science
_Some Initial Thoughts..._  
Open science is the process of making science open and accessible to all through reproducibility and availability of research data and 
analysis steps. Practicing open science allows you to get critical feedback throughout the process, rather than just towards the end 
of a project. Plus, by sharing our work, we can ask increasingly complex questions.

Open Science is a new way of doing science that focuses on cooperation and sharing of alll of the products of research.  It often uses 
digital tools that allow data sharing and collaboration.

>Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

Open Science aims to increase:
- accessibility;
- transparency;
- reproducability;
- efficiency
- innovation;
- diversity and inclusion.
